## Data Analysis and ML projects:
### [Intelligent prediction of real estate prices: from EDA and Feature Engineering to optimization of Advanced ML Models](https://github.com/amendivilsejin/ds-realstate-price-predict)

![Geolocation heatmap of properties analyzed](https://github.com/amendivilsejin/ds-realstate-price-predict/blob/main/resources/img/poperties_preview_heatmap.png)

   This project uses information collected by the real estate company [Properati](properati.com.ar/data/) until 2020, from advertisements published on its web platform by third parties in Argentina interested in promoting properties for sale. Based on the characteristics of the properties described in each advertisement, **the aim is to train machine learning models so that they can later estimate the price of new properties, based on their characteristics and the state of the real estate market**; and thus be able to offer cadastral appraisal services.
